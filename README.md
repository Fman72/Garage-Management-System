NOTE: I do not have access to the access database that the application ran with anymore.

Assignment 2 is an application made for managing the database at a car garage. It was made as an exercise for a course I took at Uni.

The application connects to a microsoft access database and allows the user to insert, delete, update and edit, service types, customers, equipment, vehicles and more. It also allows users to manage the connections between the different entities in the database (what customer owns what car, etc).
